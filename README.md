# 🍷 Python Machine Learning — Wine Quality Analysis

**Author:** Eoghan Kealy  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project Type:** Data Science / Machine Learning  
**Tools:** Python (NumPy · Pandas · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Scikit-learn · Statsmodels)

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how the chemical composition of Portuguese red and white wines relates to their quality scores.  
Using the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the notebook performs cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling to reveal the key physicochemical factors that drive wine quality.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the data distribution and variable relationships through EDA.  
- Identify significant differences between red and white wines.  
- Build and evaluate **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models to predict wine quality.  
- Apply **K-Means Clustering** to group wines with similar chemical profiles.

## 🧩 Dataset
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)  
- **Red Wine Samples:** 1 599  **White Wine Samples:** 4 898  
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical variables + quality score (0–10)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Alcohol content** shows the strongest positive correlation with wine quality.  
- **Volatile acidity** is negatively correlated — higher acidity lowers quality ratings.  
- **Sulphates** and **residual sugar** contribute moderately to higher scores.  
- Random Forest Regression achieved an R² ≈ 0.47, outperforming linear models.  
- Clustering highlights distinct wine types differentiated by sugar and acidity levels.
